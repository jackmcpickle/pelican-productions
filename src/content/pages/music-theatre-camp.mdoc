Music Theatre Camp (MTC) is an intensive two week full-day program held in the January school holidays for young performers aged 8–19. MTC offers a balance of music theatre skill building, from acting and singing to dance, alongside personal growth and confidence building. The program culminates in a full stage musical production.

Spotlight is a one week intensive for performers aged 8–14 who want a taste of the MTC experience in a shorter format.

The talent in Adelaide is nothing short of incredible and these productions are not to be missed.

For the most up-to-date schedules, audition information, and fees, refer to the current MTC and Spotlight information pack.
