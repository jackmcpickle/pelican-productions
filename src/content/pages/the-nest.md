The Nest is a hub, a hearth, a home for those who work and learn in the arts or enjoy them as an integral part of life. Located 6km from the CBD in leafy Lower Mitcham, The Nest is an inner-urban local arts precinct surrounded by residential area.

Home of Pelican Productions and Martine Quigley Dance Education, The Nest provides creative arts workshops and learning opportunities across music, dance, film, and drama for young performers, as well as a vocal workshop series for adult artists and performers.

With three large studios with sprung floors and a fourth ambient rehearsal and performing space in the original church, The Nest is also available for public hire. The venue is located at 57A Price Avenue, Lower Mitcham with ample free parking and public transport access.

The Nest, Adelaide’s newest home of cultural and community engagement, provides a place where organisations can maintain their individuality while collectively creating an active, sustainable, and accessible arts hub.
