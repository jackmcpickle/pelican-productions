    - question:
          'Q. Does my child need to audition to get a place in MTC or Spotlight?'
      answer:
          'A. If your child would like to be considered for a soloist role in
          either MTC or Spotlight they will need to attend an audition. However
          if they would prefer not to audition they will be automatically cast
          as part of the ensemble.'

          'Q. Does my child need previous experience in singing, dancing and
          acting?'
      answer:
          'A. No your child doesn’t need any previous experience at all. We do
          recommend that your child attends our Audition Workshop prior to the
          actual audition to ensure they feel confident and well prepared.'
    - question: 'Q. Can my child just enrol in MTC or Spotlight?'
      answer:

          Pelican experience and provides excellent confidence building skills.'

      answer:
          'A. The audition process is comprised of 2 parts, a singing audition
          and a dancing audition. The directors will cast according to your
          child’s ability and suitability for a role in both of these areas.'
    - question: 'Q. What does my child wear each day to MTC or Spotlight?'
      answer:
          'A. Upon enrolling into either MTC or Spotlight your child will be

          also an opportunity to purchase a 2nd t-shirt or tank top. Comfortable
