Pelican Productions was founded in October 2004 by directors Jen Frith and Kylie Green. Since then, it has grown into an important part of the South Australian performing arts community.

With a dedicated team of professional vocal tutors and choreographers, Pelican Productions nurtures young talent in musical theatre. Performers learn singing, dancing, and acting skills alongside a strong ethos of teamwork, respect, and fun.

Over the past 15 years, Pelican has hosted an intensive two-week camp during the January school holidays for performers aged 8–19, culminating in a music theatre performance. The company has also produced a number of well-known musicals including *Grease* (2013), *Disney’s The Little Mermaid JR* (2014), the Australian non-professional premiere of *Chitty Chitty Bang Bang* (2015), *Bring It On – The Musical* and *Seussical the Musical* (2017), and *Annie JR* (2018). Pelican’s productions have been nominated for and awarded multiple accolades.

Pelican Productions has also prepared and represented talent for professional musical theatre and film roles. Notable credits include *Chitty Chitty Bang Bang* (TML Enterprises), *Girl Asleep* (Windmill Theatre Company), *The Sound of Music* (Gordon Frost), *Priscilla Queen of the Desert* (Michael Cassel Group), and *Anne of Green Gables* (Emma Knights Productions).

Many former Pelicans have gone on to professional careers in musical theatre and training at performing arts colleges around Australia.
