Pelican Productions was founded in October 2004 by directors Jen Frith and Kylie
Green. Since that time it has grown into an important part of the South
Australian performing arts community. Jen, along with musical director and tutor
Ellen Gellar-Seckold, are adept at guiding students of all ages towards their
goals within the performing arts industry.

With a talented team of professional vocal tutors and choreographers, Pelican
Productions fosters young talent, encouraging them to develop their singing,
dancing, and acting skills alongside a strong ethos of teamwork, respect, and
fun.

Over the past 15 years, Pelican Productions has held an intensive two week camp
during the January school holidays for performers aged 8–19. Since 2004, it has
performed well known musicals such as _Grease_ (2013), _Disney’s The Little
Mermaid JR_ (2014), the Australian non-professional premiere of _Chitty Chitty
Bang Bang_ (2015), _Bring It On – The Musical_ and _Seussical the Musical_
(2017), and _Annie JR_ and _The Pirates of Penzance_ (2018). Many of these
productions have been nominated and awarded numerous accolades.

Pelican Productions has also prepared and supported young talent for
professional musical theatre and film roles, including _Chitty Chitty Bang Bang_
(TML Enterprises), _Girl Asleep_ (Windmill Theatre Company), _The Sound of
Music_ (Gordon Frost), _Priscilla Queen of the Desert_ (Michael Cassel Group),
and _Anne of Green Gables_ (Emma Knights Productions).
