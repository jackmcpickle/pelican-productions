Music Theatre Camp (MTC) and Spotlight were created to foster emerging talent in Adelaide’s performing arts scene. MTC is an intensive two-week day camp held in the January school holidays for performers aged 8–19, while Spotlight is a one-week intensive for performers aged 8–14.

Taking the best of Broadway and the West End, both programs culminate in a music theatre performance. The talent in Adelaide is nothing short of incredible, making these shows not to be missed.
