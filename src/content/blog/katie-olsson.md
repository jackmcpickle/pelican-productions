Katie Olsson - 10 years of fun and friendship.

Katie has been a part of Pelican Productions for 10 years. She says the MTC has
provided her with a wonderful group of friends and many opportunities.

Katie says her favourite show to be a part of was 2020's _Mamma Mia!_ where she
played the role of Ali. She says that working with the Pelican team has helped
her to grow in confidence and skills.

Katie is excited to return for the 2021 production of Chicago and looks forward
to more years at Pelican.
