Zoe Waters - a dream role for her final show.

Zoe has been with Pelican for 8 years and will be playing the role of Roxie in Chicago - High School Edition.

Zoe says her favourite Pelican show was 2019's *In the Heights*, where she played the role of Nina. She says her time at Pelican has helped her grow in confidence and performance skills.

Zoe is excited to return for Chicago in 2021 and looks forward to finishing her final show with Pelican.
