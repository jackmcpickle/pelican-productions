He has been working as a professional musician for 15 years, starting with his studies at the University of Adelaide Conservatorium and building a performance career across multiple genres. Ben has performed with The Tim Adams Band, The Royal Australian Navy Band, and the Adelaide Guitar Festival.

Ben continues to teach, perform, and direct music projects across Adelaide. We are thrilled to have him join the Pelican team for Chicago - High School Edition.
