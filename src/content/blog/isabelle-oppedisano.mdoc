Isabelle Oppedisano - an accomplished performer.

Isabelle is returning as a character in Pelican Productions' 2021 production of CHICAGO - High School Edition.

Isabelle has been a member of Pelican Productions since 2014, and has been involved in multiple camps and shows since then. Isabelle's favourite show to be a part of was 2020's production of *Mamma Mia!* where she played the role of Rosie. She says that acting is her true passion because it allows her to express herself in a way that words cannot.

She says that her time at Pelican has been a "game changer" for her confidence and skills. Isabelle notes that being in a creative environment surrounded by talented people has helped her develop her performance abilities and build a strong support network.

Isabelle is looking forward to the 2021 production of Chicago and is eager to continue her performing journey with Pelican.
