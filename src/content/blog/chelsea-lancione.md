Chelsea Lancione - a passion for performance.

Chelsea has been with Pelican for 12 years and will be playing one of the "Cell
Block Tango" girls in Chicago - High School Edition. She says her favourite show
to be a part of was 2018's _Annie_, where she played one of the orphans.

Chelsea says that Pelican has been a place where she has been able to express
herself and grow as a performer. She says her confidence has grown because of
the supportive environment.

Chelsea is excited to return for Chicago in 2021.
