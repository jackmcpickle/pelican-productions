Amy Gallery - a life of dance.

Amy has been dancing since she was 5 years old and has been a part of Pelican
for 4 years. She was in the 2019 production of _In the Heights_ and will be
playing June in Chicago - High School Edition.

Amy says that Pelican has been a place where she has been able to grow as a
performer and make close friendships.

She is excited for Chicago 2021 and for more years with Pelican.
