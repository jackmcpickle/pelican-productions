Hannah Brown - a "Step in time".

Hannah has been with Pelican Productions since she was 6 years old. She will be
playing the role of June in Chicago - High School Edition. She says that her
favourite show to be a part of was _Mary Poppins_, where she played the role of
Katie Nana.

Hannah says the MTC provides her with the opportunity to be herself in a
supportive environment and that she loves being part of the Pelican family.

Hannah hopes to pursue a career in musical theatre and is excited for the 2021
production of Chicago.
