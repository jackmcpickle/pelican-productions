Henny Walters - a final farewell.

Henny has been with Pelican for 6 years and will be playing Velma in Chicago - High School Edition. She says her favourite show to be a part of was 2019's *In the Heights* where she played the role of Camila.

Henny says Pelican has given her the opportunity to build confidence and work with an encouraging team. She is proud of her time at Pelican and looks forward to performing in her final show.
