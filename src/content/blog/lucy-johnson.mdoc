Lucy Johnson - a decade of Music Theatre Camp.

Lucy has been with Pelican for 10 years and is a 2021 MTC veteran. She will be playing the role of Matron "Mama" Morton in Chicago - High School Edition.

Lucy says her favourite Pelican show was 2017's *Seussical the Musical*, where she played the role of Bird Girl. She says that her time at Pelican has helped her develop skills and confidence, and she loves performing.

Lucy is excited to return for the 2021 production of Chicago.
